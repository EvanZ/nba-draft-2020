Big Board
============================
> Tiers represent my attempt to classify each player according to a realistic ceiling outcome in terms of overall league impact. Tiers are "exponentially" distributed, meaning higher tiers have increasingly fewer players relative to lower tiers. This is based on the idea of the "long tail" of NBA talent distribution: Very few truly elite players (so-called "superstars") and many, many role players.

## Tier I
>MVP/All-NBA 1st or 2nd Team/Supermax

Empty - In previous years, this tier would have a player such as Luka or Zion.
