## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 36% 3P% (591 3PA since 2017)
- 79% FT% (474 FTA since 2017)
- 1.68 A:TO in Euroleague in 2019
- 32% AST%
- 51% 2P% 
- 14.4% DRB%
```

```{Caution}
- 1% STL% in Euroleague in 2019 (2.27% in Jeep Elite)
- 23% USG in 2019 (similar splits between EL and Jeep Elite competition)
- 33% 3P% in 2019 (117 3PA split between EL and Jeep Elite)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting: The shooting stats are pretty damn good, especially given he was an 18-year old playing at a high level. I buy 
the shooting and for my money (of which there is none), he's one of the top 3-4 overall shooting prospects in this class.
- Frame: Looks to me like a great frame to pack on some more muscle by the time he's fully baked. Is it crazy to see a bit
of Brogdon here?
- Likes to draw contact: One of the things that stands out when I watch Maledon is his driving, even though he doesn't have great burst,
he uses his body well and seems to get guys to hang on his back. Smooth operator.
- Passing: Theo is more on the "safe and willing" passer end of the spectrum than a true visionary. But I don't think he'll 
ever hurt a team here, especially if he ends up being more of a secondary or third banana (which seems likely).
- Defensive potential: I think with his size and length he has the potential to be a 2-position defender. 
- Age: One of the younger players in the Class won't turn 20 until Summer after rookie season.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Athleticism: Not a bad athlete, not a great one. Will have to use his size and strength to his advantage. Again I'd suggest the role model
for him to look to is probably a guy like Brogdon.
- Caught between positions: My guess is he's ideally a nominal point guard on a team with another primary (similar to a lot 
of guards in this Draft).
