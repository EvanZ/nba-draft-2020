## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 82.5% FT% career (143 FTA)
- 41% 3P% career (290 3PA)
- 95%-ile spot-up and 97%-ile off screens according to Synergy in 2019
- 52.2% 3P% 2019 (115 3PA)
- 13.1 3PA per 100 possessions
```

```{Caution}
- 0.31 FTR
- 0.77 A:TO in 2 seasons / 1.5 AST per 100 poss
- 6.9% AST% in 2019 (10.8% in 2018)
- 56% FG% at the rim in 2019 (60% in 2018)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting: Ran insanely hot in just 14 games before getting injured. Important to keep in mind this was almost entirely before he got
into conference play. Has a good looking stroke. My only quibble or question is if it is a tad slow, especially
off movement. Great FT% corroborates the 3pt shooting story.
- Frame: Has nearly ideal size for an NBA wing these days.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Athleticism: I would say he's just an ok athlete in every sense. (I just copy/pasted from Saddiq Bey's profile.)
- What else does he do?: We talk about guys who absolutely "need to shoot" and Nesmith
to me is one of those guys. If his shooting doesn't pan out, he's a fringe NBA player along the lines of Wes Johnson.
