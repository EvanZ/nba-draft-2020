## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 83.8% FT% (74 FTA)
- 2.5% STL%
- 5.6% BLK%
- 0.36 FTR
```

```{Caution}
- 32% 3P% (only 50 3PA)
- 0.58 A:TO
- 7 missed dunk attempts (25-32)
- 62.4% FG% at the rim
```


## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Size/Frame: Potential to be a big bully wing if skillset develops enough. Positional scarcity/value proposition is obvious.
- Self-creation potential: This involves quite a bit of projection, but Williams showed some intriguing flashes of self-creation,
especially in the mid-range. Has a fairly decent handle already for his size/age, although clearly has a ways to go. One 
could imagine his offense developing along the lines of a Marcus Morris. I like that he is already starting to use his left hand on finishes.
- Motor/Competitive: Played hard coming off the bench for Leonard Hamilton. Clearly a team player. 
- Age: Ongoing theme for most of the guys I'm really high on. Young players tend to be the ones on the steepest part of their
development curves, and that's part of the bet with PatWill.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Perimeter defense: Does he move well enough to be a truly versatile/switchable defender?
- Shooting: Obviously he needs the 3pt shooting to really develop to be worthy of being a top pick. I'm encouraged
by the free throw shooting and mid-range jumper, but there is obvious downside risk here. I'm no shot doctor, but perhaps,
he can benefit from flattening his "moonball" shot just a tad.
- Length: I know it seems odd citing length as a weakness for PatWill, but it's all relative. The point here is simply
that while being 6'8" with a 6'11" wingspan is great for a wing or even a big wing, it probably isn't good enough
to use him much as a small ball 5, which would increase his future value even more. But I'm probably splitting hairs at this point.
