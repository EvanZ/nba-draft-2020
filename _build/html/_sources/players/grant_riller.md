## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 35.6% 3P% (526 3PA career)
- 0.47 FTR 2019 (0.391 career)
- 61.6% TS on 29% USG in 4 seasons (2019 not an outlier season)
- 70.6% FG% at the rim (10 dunks)
- 40% mid-range jumpers (97% unassisted!)
- 82% unassisted on *all* field goal attempts
- 97%-ile PNR 96%-ile Spot-up 87%-ile ISO (Synergy)
```

```{Caution}
- 1.28 A:TO
- 7.5 3PA per 100 possessions
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shot creation/PNR: This is Riller's calling card, as he's arguably the best shot creator in the class, able to pull up or
get to the rim almost at will. Granted (no pun) Riller is in a weaker conference not known for much defense, but I feel like
we've seen that story play out enough to have some confidence it can translate.
- Improving playmaking: Definitely tends towards the "head down scorer" mentality but he's not a total zero when it comes to making plays
for others. Experience in a heavy PNR offense. Optimistically, hoping for a poor man's James Harden role.
- Underrated athleticism: If a 6'3" guard has 10 dunks on a season, he can't be *that* bad an athlete right? Also given that 
he shot 70% at the rim, he has the strength, touch and craft to make up for not being a great athlete or having elite length.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Defensive concerns: If the hope is Riller is a poor man's Harden on offense, which would be a solid NBA role player at the least,
of much greater concern is that he is also a poor man's Harden on defense. If it's that bad, he might have trouble staying on the 
court even if he is a legit offensive player.
- Age: Not the oldest player in the class, but damn near. The one thing I'd say here is that Riller has been pretty much the
same player the last two seasons (arguably longer than that) even if NBA teams have only more recently been paying attention. I don't
think this is a case of a guy having an outlier season at an old age (hi Wes Johnson).
