## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 84.5% FT% (478 FTA)
- 3.0 STL% career
- 17.1% AST%
- 0.41 FTR
- 98%-ile PNR-Ball Handler (Synergy)
```

```{Caution}
- 34.5% 3P% (501 3PA; 39.4% in 2019)
- 56.9% FG% at rim in 2019 (167 FGA)
- 20% USG
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting potential: 3 seasons of mediocre to bad 3P% but shot 39% his SR season and has been an elite FT shooter
his entire career. Has deep range. I'm a believer!
- Playmaking/Ball Handling: One of the underrated "feel" guys in this class. Could help teams in a multitude of ways even 
as he transitions to a more off-ball role in the NBA.
- 3&D?: Will rely on strength and IQ to offset athletic/length disadvantage, but consistent 3% STL% over 4 seasons suggests
some defensive potential.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Finishing: Mays is pretty good at getting to the rim, but struggles to finish efficiently.
- Off-ball shooting: Not much success or evidence of shooting off movement. Development in this area would really boost
his chance of success.
- Athleticism/Length: I do think Mays is more athletic than he looks. Is there some #FatUpside here? Length is average
or below for an off guard/wing role.
