## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 83.3% FT% (120 FTA)
- 65.1% FG% at the rim (80% unassisted)
- 12.1% DRB%
```

```{Caution}
- 29% 3P% (113 3PA; 90% assisted)
- 6.2 3PA per 100 poss
- 1.5% STL%
- 22.7% USG
- 53.1% TS%
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Potential for shooting: Although the 3pt shooting % was bad, his shot passes the eye test and his strong
free throw shooting percentage suggest that he simply ran very cold on 3s this season. Interior finishing was also very good
which further validates skill level. 
- Latent point guard ability?: Is Maxey another "Calipari special" that looks much better in the NBA than at Kentucky? If Hagans
wasn't given the reins would Maxey have been a capable point guard and furthermore was he done a disservice by playing out of his
natural position all season? These are tough counterfactuals but I would say I am starting to buy into the idea that UK is not
always the best evaluation context. At any rate, Maxey is a good and willing passer.
```

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Actual shooting: I mean he didn't shoot 3s well at all, especially for a player who is perceived as a combo guard at the next
level. Like I said above, I can buy to some extent he ran cold, I guess the question is how cold? Arguably even more of a concern
than the 3P% itself is the relatively low volume at which he shot them (although ironically the small sample size makes it
somewhat easier to explain the low percentage). 
- Defensive value?: There's only so much you can expect from a 6'3" guard not named Marcus Smart on defense, although
to be fair Maxey could definitely be one of the best 6'3" and under defenders from this class.
