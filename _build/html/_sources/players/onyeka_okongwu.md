## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 9.8% BLK%
- 2.3% STL%
- 0.50 FTR
- 72% FT% (143 FTA)
- 58 dunks
- 72.6% FG% at the rim (186 FGA; 43% unassisted)
- 41.5% mid-range (94 FGA)
```

```{Caution}
- 0.55 A:TO
- 4 3PA (made 1!)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Translatable archetype: Not sure how else to say it succintly, but Okongwu is a player mould that tends to perform well
in the NBA, including guys like Bam, Favors, Horford, Ibaka, Capela and Tristan Thompson. What 20 years ago were considered
"undersized" 5s or underskilled 4s now look like versatile 5s who can help teams on both sides of the ball. I don't know exactly
where Oknongwu ends up in this spectrum, but to me he is one of the most projectable "safe" bets in the Draft
to be playing in 10 years.
- Athletic profile: Not quite as elite as Bam or even a young Favors in my opinion, nevertheless, a really good athlete who should
be able to defend inside and not be a liability on the perimeter. 
- Rim running threat: Provides this from Day 1.
- Rim protector: Probably won't be quite as elite at the next level, but should be a plus regardless.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Shooting/Floor spacing: Shot 72% from the line and displays nice touch around the rim, so this is not hopeless. At the same time,
it's a skill he could add to take his game to a higher tier.
- Ball Handling/Playmaking: This is not to say he's bad at either for his position, but let's put aside the "next Bam" talk
for now.
