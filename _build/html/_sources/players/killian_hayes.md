## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 85.8% FT% (282 FTA since 2017)
- 3.1% STL% 
- 59.1% TS 
- 24% USG%
- 1.68 A:TO
- 58.8% 2P% (182 2PA in 2019-20)
```

```{Caution}
- 27.8% 3P% (331 3PA since 2017)
- 29.4% 3P% (102 3PA in 2019-20)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Size/Length: Strong frame and good length for a point guard.
- Age: One of the youngest players in the class, case for upside.
- Passing: Maybe not the vision of a Haliburton, but I think I give Hayes the overall edge in playmaking
with his ball handling advantage. To be clear, not in the Melo/Luka/Simmons tier.
- Creation: Pull-up capability is a weapon.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Shooting (especially off-ball): Youth, overall skill level, and elite FT% mitigate much of my concern about his 3PT
efficiency.
- Left-hand dominance: Much has been made of this in terms of his passing, which I'm not super concerned about actually.
More of a concern in my mind is right-hand finishing.
- Athleticism: A good athlete, not a great one, bla, bla. Probably more of a concern on the defensive end.
