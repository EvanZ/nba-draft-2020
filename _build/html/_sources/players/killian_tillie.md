## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 44.4% 3P% (239 3PA career)
- 75% FT% (196 FTA)
- 3.6% BLK%
- 2.2% STL%
- 13.1% AST% / 1.3 A:TO career (1.88 2019-20)
```

```{Caution}
- 20% USG career
- 7 dunks
- 12.8% TRB%
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting: Shot >= 40% on 3s every single season. I absolutely believe in him as a spot-up shooter that can stretch the floor
as a 4 or a small 5 (most likely plays 4 most of the time due to rim protection concerns).
- Playmaking/Feel: For me he's arguably the smartest player in college basketball the last few years. There's just a 
feeling I get watching him that he is on another tier in terms of seeing the game. It's a shame we didn't really get to see him
at 100% with Clarke and Rui in 2019. Would have been a truly special team.
- Overall skill level: From ball handling to his touch around the rim, Tillie just shows a high level of skill that I 
think can translate to a playmaking role in the NBA.
- Underrated defender: He is not long and he is not very athletic, but he has great instincts and just knows where to be. I think
he'll be a better defender than people realize, even acknowledging some of his physical limitations.
```

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Injury concerns: He has a fairly lengthy history of injuries now, so it's obviously a concern. I'm not a doctor
and I don't have his medical records so I can't really know how serious the concerns are long term. Also important to
note that aside from just the concern about missing games, there's also just the fact that injuries may have
affected his athleticism previously and going forward. DYODD.
- Short arms: Similar to Bane a negative wingspan guy. Surprisingly, even with this deficiency he is able to block some shots
with his timing and positioning, but this will be even more challenging at the next level obviously. For this reason, it's 
hard to project Tillie as a 5 even in small lineups, although I'm not going to totally discount the possibility. 
- Athleticism: He's pretty quick on his feet, but not explosive at all really. Again, it's difficult to evaluate in some respect
given his injuries. Perhaps, there's some upside here if he's fully healthy.
