## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 107 dunks
- 41.7% 3P% (103 3PA since 2018)
- 70.6% FT% (228 FTA)
- ~1.0 A:TO
- 14.5 AST%
```

```{Caution}
- 4.1% BLK%
- 14.5% TRB%
- 2.1 PF per 40 (suspiciously low!)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Explosive verticality: Only a handful of NCAA players have had over 100 dunks in a season. He can really jump out of the gym.
- Playmaking: Very underrated part of his game. Passing reminds me a bit of a David Lee or Blake Griffin "lite".
- Shooting: I don't think I'm quite as convinced on his shooting ability as many are, given a relatively small sample
and just average FT%, but clearly there is good reason for optimism. Passes the eye test as a spot-up shooter.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Lateral movement/Perimeter Defense: One of the rare players where it's immediately obvious he will have issues defending on the perimeter.
Very stiff and also for someone who seems very smart on offense, lacks some awareness on the other end.
- Rim protection: As explosive as he is on offense, he doesn't really use his length and verticality as well as a rim protector.
- Trap archetype?: Given the previous two items, one can't help but think we've seen this movie before with players like 
David Lee, Blake Griffin, John Collins, and even Larry Nance. Gifted offensively but very problematic on defense seemingly
has made it difficult to build around players in this mould.
- Age: On top of the archetype questions, it should be noted Toppin will be 23 before his first rookie season is over.
