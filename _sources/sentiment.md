I ran a bunch of polls on Twitter to gauge sentiment on prospects (the tweet poll for LaMelo Ball is shown above). {numref}`sentiment-fig` summarizes the results and orders players by an MVP-like voting system which gives 4 points for the top tier, 3 points for the next tier, and so on. Because Twitter limits polls to 4 options, I couldn't fit all 6 of my tier definitions, but this should be a pretty good approximation of #DraftTwitter sentiment (biased of course by my followers). Total votes in parentheses.
