## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 36.2% 3P% (304 3PA FR+SO)
- 79.3% FT% (246 FTA FR+SO)
- 18 blocks (nearly top in nation at his size)
- 50.7% 2P% (296 2PA)

```{Caution}
- 57.6% FG% at the rim (only 19.7% AST though)
- 9.1% DRB%
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Speed: Elite burst/speed which enables him to blow by defenders in transition or half court.
- Age: Was too young to qualify for the Draft after his Freshman season. He is about the median
age for a Freshman in this class. For all intents and purposes, one should probably compare his development curve
to other Freshmen.
- Shooting: All signs point to being above-average, if not elite, shooter at the next level. Although most likely to
be on ball most of the time, he could thrive off ball in small guard lineups as well. Could be lethal attacking closeouts.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Frame: While possessing decent length and height, he's very slender. Almost certainly a 1-position defender, although it is 
interesting to note his insanely high number of blocks. Statistical oddity or defensive signal? Hard to say.
- Finishing: Not a great finisher around the rim right now, probably owing mostly to lack of verticality and strength. Both are 
areas that might be improved upon, otherwise, Kira will need to work on his craftiness around the rim. 
- Athleticism: As mentioned above, elite speed, but lacks vertical explosion. 
- Statistical context: Kira played in an extremely fast and wide open system at Alabama, which probably gives him a bit of a 
"prospect halo". Hard to know how significant this is, but worth noting.
