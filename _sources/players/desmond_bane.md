## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 80.4% FT% (270 FTA in 4 seasons)
- 43.3% 3P% (575 3PA in 4 seasons)
- 1.7 A:TO in 2019 (1.68 career)
- 2.5% STL% in 2019 (1.8% career)
- 26% AST% in 2019 (16.1% career)
```

```{Caution}
- 0.13 FTR in 2019 (0.20 career)
- 31% FG% mid-range
- improved from <10% unassisted 3s to 33% in 2019
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting: To me he's one of the surest bets to be an above-average, if not elite, shooter in this Draft. Can shoot
off movement and has deep range.
- Strength: Built like a brick you-know-what. That's got to be good for something.
- Playmaking: From what I've seen he's a very capable passer and feels like a guy who will make the right play most of the time.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Length: Below average wingspan/reach for an NBA wing. Can he thrive as a 3&D guy with essentially below average tools?
- Athleticism: Not a terrible athlete, but not really exceptional in any way.
- Shot-creation: Although to an extent he can make up for lack of burst and advanced handles with his strength, it's 
hard to see Bane ever becoming much of a scoring threat outside of his 3pt shooting.
- Defensive versatility: I can see the theoretical upside of Bane as a switchable defender given his IQ and strength, but
but in the end I think I'm more concerned about his really short arms and just average athletic profile. I guess he needs to
convince me here. If he does, there's no doubt Bane could be a super valuable 3&D guy.
