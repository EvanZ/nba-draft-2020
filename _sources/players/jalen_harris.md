## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 35.9% 3P% (315 3PA)
- 83.8% FT% (277 FTA)
- 22 dunks
- 15.3% DRB%
- 21.4% AST%
- 1.31 A:TO career (1.64 in 2019)
- 29.7% USG (32.7% in 2019)
```

```{Caution}
- 61% FG% at rim in 2019
- 2.0% STL%
- 77.6% 3PA assisted
- only 4 blocks in 2019 (low for his size/athletic profile)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Microwave scoring potential: Harris had a string of 4 or 5 games scoring over 30 this season. Was fairly efficient in a
high usage role. Potential to score inside and outside. 
- Athleticism: One of the more underrated athletes in the class. 
- Passing: Good enough that he shouldn't be thought of as one-dimensional. 
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Defensive concerns: Projects more as a bench scorer (ala LouWill) then a starting 2.
