## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 41.7% 3P% (168 3PA since 2018)
- 2.0 A:TOV over 2 seasons
- 2.8% STL%
- 4.1% BLK%
- 26 dunks
- 70% FG% at the rim
```

```{Caution}
- 20% USG
- 0.22 FTR
- 72% FT% (93 FTA)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Defensive versatility: Could be the best 1-3 defender in the Draft. Has the combination of length, feel, and athleticism
to be a disruptor on the defensive end on the perimeter and near the basket. Demonstrated that constistently in 2 seasons.
- Intangibles: One of the most competitive and driven players in the Draft. Like to bet on guys like this to improve their skills continually.
- Shooting: Projects to be a good spot-up shooter, at the very least.
- Safe passer: Maybe not the most flashy play maker, but unselfish, and can count on him to make the right pass when he needs to. 
Don't think he'll ever bog down an offense or be a weak link.
- Age: August birthday makes him younger than a few Freshmen.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Strength/Frame: Relatively thin build especially in his lower body.  
- Self-creation: Thought of primarily as a 3&D guy, but definitely showed some ability this year to create his own shots.
Leonard Hamilton's offense is so balanced (the top usage among regular rotation guys was 22.9%), that it may have hid Vassell a bit.
I think I'm probably higher on his upside as a creator than consensus, just based on his current skill level, and his desire to compete.
At the very least, it seems to me he should be fairly competent attacking closeouts and slashing on occasion.
- Shooting off movement: Mostly spotting up or pulling up from mid-range, I'm not sure how good Vassell is shooting on the move.
I'd call this more of a question mark than an actual weakness.
