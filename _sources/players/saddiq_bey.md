## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 1.6 A:TO / 14.9% AST%
- 41.8% 3P% (306 3PA in 2 seasons)
- 72.8% FT% (136 FTA)
```

```{Caution}
- 0.25 FTR
- 22.8% USG (increased from 14.4% FR season)
- 1.4% STL%
- 1.2% BLK%
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting: Great spot-up shooting (98%-ile according to Synergy) with a high, if somewhat unorthodox release. Not a lot of
evidence of movement shooting, so that's a bit of a question mark.
- Size: Has size to be a 4, which is probably where he's best suited on both sides of the ball.
- Motor/Intangibles: If I had to pick a guy with Jimmy Butler intensity in this Draft, I think Bey is on the short list. At least,
on offense.
- Playmaking: Not an elite handler or passer, but probably better than most people think. 
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Athleticism: I would say he's just an ok athlete in every sense.
- Theoretical 3&D?: Einstein famously said:
> In theory, theory and practice are the same thing. In practice they are not.


Or maybe Iverson said that. Regardless, point being I'm not sure the theoretical 3&D label ubiquitously attached to Bey
at this point is actually true in practice. We'll see!
- Age: Fairly old sophomore. Two years older than fellow soph Kira Lewis!
