## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 74.8% FT% (310 FTA)
- 18.6% TRB%
- 11.1% AST% (16.4% as SOPH)
```

```{Caution}
- 30.9% 3P% (110 3PA)
- 0.66 A:TO (0.8 as SOPH)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Strength/Frame: "NBA-Ready" body. A bit undersized for a starting 5, although decent wingspan and reach. 
- Shooting potential: While his 3P% is mediocre, he passes the eye test for me and the free throw percentage is at a level
where it gives me some confidence the 3PT shot will come eventually. 
- Ball handling: Actually pretty advanced handle for his size and projected position especially evident on drives to the rim,
which could really be his swing skill. 
- Passing: While he's seen primarily as a bully scorer type, I think he's an underrated passer.  
```

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Defensive concerns: Is he a 4 or a 5? Does he give you enough rim protection as a 5? Is he quick enough on his feet
to defend on the perimeter if he's a 4? He's going to have to prove that most likely.  
Even putting aside the physical questions, Perry is not a savant on defense either. Markieff Morris could be a decent comp
in terms of this side of the ball (and not too shabby on the other side to be honest).
- Intangibles/Mentality: I was disappointed to hear from multiple sources that there are some questions about Perry's coachibility,
specifically, that the dude has a giant ego. Personally, I'm not putting a lot of weight on this in terms
of where I'm ranking him, but thought I'd mention it for posterity.
