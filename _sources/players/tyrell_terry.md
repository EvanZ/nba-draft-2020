## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Shooting: Could end up being the best shooter in the Draft. Has deep range, quick release, can shoot off movement or 
pull up. 
- Feel/Playmaking: I think Stanford's very democratic offense kind of hid Terry a bit here, but his ability to read the court
and anticipate plays in near the top of the class in my opinion. I'll freely admit my bias here since I live quite close to 
Stanford and saw him live several times. 
- Offensive role flexibility: Will have no problem playing off the ball, but I think he will surprise to the upside with his
ability to play on the ball. 
- Defensive effort: I have doubts like everyone else about how much he will contribute on defense, but I do think the effort 
and toughness is there for him to not totally shit the bed. Quite frequently stood in the way of oncoming traffic to attempt
to draw contact in a way most guys his size would avoid. So he gets some credit there from me.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Size/Athletic concerns: Despite reportedly growing to 6'3" 175 lbs in the off-season there are obviously going to be concerns
about his size until he proves there aren't. While not a top tier athlete, he's probably a bit underrated in this regard. 
But clearly he's going to have to survive/thrive on his skill level and intelligence.
- Finishing/Mid-range/Floaters: As good of an outside shooter as Terry was, there are some legit questions about his interior
and mid-range scoring. To the former, he has touch and craft around the rim, but he gets his shot blocked a ton. He's not the first
player to have to figure it out, but I am betting he will. Similarly, he needs to continue working on his floater and mid-range 
pull-up game, especially if he desires to transition to more of a primary offensive role. Again, my opinion is someone with his
skill level usually figures these things out---with some notable exceptions, looking at you Devonte' Graham!
- Ball-handling concerns: The oft-mentioned comps to Trae and Steph really fall apart in this area. If Tyrell could handle the ball like either
of those two guys, he's probably a top 5 pick in this Draft. To be clear, he's not a terrible ball handler
but this is an area where he probably needs outlier improvement to make GM's regret on passing him.
