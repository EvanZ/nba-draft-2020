## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 78% FT% (109 FTA)
- 36% 3P% (83 3PA)
- 2.8% STL%
- 1.59 A:TOV / 16% AST%
- 24 dunks
```

```{Caution}
- 28% FG% mid-range 2s
- only 1 unassisted 3pt make
- 20.7% USG
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Athleticism: One of the best all-around athletes in the class.
- Frame/Length: Prototypical 2-guard size, should be able to slide up to 3 as well.
- 3&D Potential: Along with Vassell, I think Green is arguably the best 3&D prospect in this class. While there is some
disagreement, personally, I think his shooting stroke is smooth, compact and efortless. He probably needs to speed it up a bit
to become more of a movement shooter, and I'm not a fan of the rather extreme knee valgus, but otherwise, I'm pretty confident
in his shooting profile.
- Transition offense: With his defensive tools and ability to run the floor, I can see easy scoring opportunities here.
- Intangibles: Good motor, energy, competitive (Aussie genes?).
- Passing: He's fairly underrated here. Feels like a guy you can trust to make good decisions when he has the ball. Not a ball stopper.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Age: One of the older Freshmen prospects (turns 20 right before the Draft).
- Handle/Self-creation: Currently doesn't have much of an advanced handle. Can attack closeouts, but 
he's probably not going to be much of a creator, at least, early in his career. Flashes some nice spin moves on occasion, 
not sure how much this will translate. His slashing ability will be enhanced if his shot proves to be legit.
