## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 27-27 dunks/att
- 69% FG% at the rim; 38% assisted
- 77% FT%
- 12.9 3PA per 100 poss
- 30.4% USG%
- 14.8% DRB%
```

```{Caution}
- 29.4% 3P% (245 3PA)
- 1.04 A:TOV
- 52% TS%
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Tools: Upper echelon guard frame in terms of strength, although +4 wingspan is a couple inches shy of being truly elite; 
Just turned 19, he could really be a brick wall on ice skates by the time he's fully developed physically.
- Athleticism: Probably goes without saying one of the best all around athletes in the class. Probably would have made a great linebacker or safety.
- Age: 3rd youngest in class; does not turn 20 until Summer 2021
- Good skill baseline: Although he lacked 3PT efficiency, has the ability to get his shot off with relative ease and deep range; 
Solid ball handling with some advanced skills; Flashes passing vision, creativity
```
```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Motor: It's somewhat of a question. Would like to see someone with his tools and physical advantage dominate more on the defensive end, even if he doesn't have the know how or awareness yet.
Can explain away some of this due to heavy offensive burden? Rebounded fairly well which is, perhaps, somewhat redeeming as well. 
No doubt this will be a question until it isn't.
- Awareness/Feel: Is he a primary who is capable of making his teammates better or is he a gunner (ala Dion Waiters) destined to 
play a volume scoring role on a bad team? Sure he's young, but
there are other very young guys (LaMelo, Poku) in this Draft who possess great feel for the game. It can only be developed
so much, and it's not clear whether Edwards will ever have enough of it. Can you get much out of him in an off ball role, if necessary?
- Shooting: 29% 3P% on fairly high volume, this is somewhat of a concern. Can explain away some inefficiency due to high volume of difficult attempts, 
but it's still somewhat discomforting to bet on a shooting guard that hasn't yet proven he's efficient at...shooting. 
Good FT% and eye test somewhat mitigates this concern.
