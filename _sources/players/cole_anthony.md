## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 34.8% 3P% (141 3PA)
- 75% FT% (128 FTA)
- 75% of FGA unassisted (92% at the rim)
- 30% USG
- 16.4% DRB%
- 74%-ile Spot-Up; 92% ISO according to Synergy
```

```{Caution}
- 1.15 A:TO
- 40.2% 2P%
- 53.6% FG% at the rim
- 50.1% TS%
- 24%-ile Transition; 38%-ile PNR-Ball Handler (Synergy)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- "Prior": In some sense his ranking/reputation coming into college might be the best argument for still betting on him.
Can he possibly be as bad as he seemed at UNC? Dealing with his own injuries and pretty bad team context, perhaps, one
needs to cut the man some slack. The question is how much?
- Strength: Not going to wow anyone with his length, but he does have a strong compact frame going for him. Could he 
follow a PatBev type trajectory if he really focused on hounding defense as a calling card?
- Perimeter shooting: It may look odd listing this as a strength, but perhaps, his shooting is a bit underrated at this point,
especially because shooting off the dribble gives him a bit more gravity than otherwise might be expected.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Efficiency: Even given his injuries and high usage role some of his numbers are frankly astonighingly bad for a prospect
as highly touted as he was coming into UNC. It's just hard to see that it would ever turn around to the point where
he's a highly efficient scorer at the next level.
- Athletic concerns: This was supposed to be an area of strength for Cole. He ended up with 3 dunks on the year and finished 
below the rim (and badly) most of the season. What happened? Do injuries entirely explain away the disconnect?
- Playmaking: Great point guards make their teammates better but all we talk about is how bad his teammates were and how much
scoring load Cole took upon himself. How good of a passer is he really?
- Self-creation/Scorer mentality: Feels like his destiny might be a 6MOY type scoring role. Could he adjust to an off-ball role?
- Age: Unfortunately, on top of many other issues discussed, Cole Anthony is quite an old Freshman.
