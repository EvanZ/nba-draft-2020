## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Strength/Frame/Toughness: He'll get the "undersized" label, but Tillman can more than hold his own physically with his strength
and grit. With his length and timing he can actually provide decent enough rim protection to play him at the 5 when a team
wants (or has) to go small.
- Playmaking/Feel: He's right up there with Tillie in terms of thinking the game. Makes all the right plays and is also 
super competitive. Aside from the MSU connection (and jersey number), there's a reason people mention Draymond Green as a comp.
- Ball handling: Probably not going to be good enough to create his own offense much, but might be able to 
serve in the Draymond-type role of bringing the ball up the court after a rebound and making a play for a teammate.
- Intangibles: Seems to me one of the most highly competitive and unselfish players in the class. Feels like a guy who is
going to maximize everything he has. Sorry, I'm not intentionally trying to reinforce the Draymond comp, but it is what it is!
- Defense: Certainly one of the best college defenders the last couple of years. Mentally he's got everything he needs to succeed on defense.
```

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Shooting: Tillman would be much higher on everyone's board if they saw great potential for shooting. Maybe eventually he 
gives you some spot-up shooting, but it's unlikely to be a significant part of his game. 
- Defense: Yes I listed this as a strength, but ultimately if he is not a complete stud (ala Draymond) on defense, his impact
will probably be fairly limited.
- Athleticism: He's not a bad athlete by any means, but the fact that he's probably just an average athlete by NBA standards 
means he really has to make up for it in other ways (anticipation, using his length, etc).
- He's not Draymond (aka lightning doesn't strike twice very often): I really like Tillman, but Draymond Green is a HOF player. 
How valuable is a "poor man's Draymond"? I'm not trying to be glib here, just realistically Tillman probably has to hit
on everything to be a good starting 4.
