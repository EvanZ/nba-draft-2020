```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.

>Unicorn outcome in play if he can handle the physicality of the NBA game. Barely old enough to qualify for the Draft, a patient far-sighted team could be greatly rewarded for taking a leap of faith.
