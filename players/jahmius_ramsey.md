## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 42.6% 3P% (141 3PA)
- 0.421 3PA per 100 poss
- 2.5% STL%
- 2.5% BLK%
- 12.4% DRB%
- 16.1% AST%
- 26.2% USG%
```

```{Caution}
- 64.1% FT% (78 FTA)
- 1.1 A:TO
- made only 5 dunks on 9 dunk attempts
- 52.5% FG% at rim
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Strength/Frame: Uh, yeah. Strong frame. You've probably seen the shirtless pics just like I have.
- Shooting potential: Do we believe the 3P% or the FT%? Somewhere in the middle most likely, but that
may still be pretty good.
- Shot creation: Kind of a poor man's Anthony Edwards when you think about it. Less athletic, but can create space
and rise up for his shot quickly.
- Age: Always a plus!
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Playmaking: Seems like a guy who hunts his shot. At his size will want to improve his passing
or be destined for a bench scorer role. 
- Athleticism: Looks more athletic than he really is?
- Length: Lack of elite length or athleticism lead to inefficient interior scoring. This is also a concern on the 
defensive end, although he did have an oddly high block rate.
