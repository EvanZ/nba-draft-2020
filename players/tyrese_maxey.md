## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
