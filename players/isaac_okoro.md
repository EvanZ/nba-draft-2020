## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 60.7% 2P%
- 1.0 A:TO / 13.1% AST%
- 0.55 FTR
- 3.1% BLK%
- 19 dunks
```

```{Caution}
- 67.2% FT% (134 FTA)
- 28.6% 3P% (70 3PA)
- 1.7% STL%
- 19.6% USG%
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Athleticism/Strength: Linebacker (tight end?) build and athleticism combination, arguably same tier as Anthony Edwards.
If he gets a head of steam going, watch out. In traffic and tight spaces not quite as explosive in my opinion.
- Intangibles: Motor, grit, and competitiveness seem top notch.
- Passing: Not an elite playmaker, but a very good one. 
- Slashing: If the shot ever comes around, it should open up his slashing game. 
- Sinistral finishing: Looks like he has soft touch with the left hand, which is a good sign.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Shooting: Full stop. Ultimate ceiling value rides on how much he can improve here. 
- Length: Ideally, with his current skill development and lack of shooting, Okoro would probably benefit from having a few more inches
of wingspan and reach so you could bump him up to a 4 or super small 5. It is what it is.
- Overrated defensive potential?: Much of his prospect value rides on the perception of Okoro being an almost instantly elite
defender at the next level. I would just point out that historically, having a STL% < 2% is a bit of a red flag for any prospect,
let alone one that is projected to be an elite defender. For reference, Marcus Smart (a frequent comp for Okoro) averaged
5.2% in his two seasons at OSU. Again, I'm not trying to say Okoro is a trash defender or anything like that. I'm just questioning
if his defensive value is quite as high as being projected for a player that really does depend on it. This stat makes me hedge a bit on the enthusiasm there.
And perhaps, it can be explained away within the context of Auburn's defensive scheme.
