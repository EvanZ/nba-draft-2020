## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```
```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 42.6% 3P% (237 3PA career)
- 77.5% FT% (71 FTA career)
- 3.8% STL% in 2019 (2.7% 2018)
- 2.5% BLK% career (1.3 BLK per 100 poss)
- 3.0 A:TO career (2.3 in 2019; 4.5 2018)
- 35% AST% in 2019
- 74% FG% at the rim (62 FGA)
```

```{Caution}
- 20.1% USG in 2019 (doubled from 9% in 2018!)
- 0.184 FTR / only 3.2 FTA per 100 poss in 2019
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Passing: Incredible playmaker, especially for a guy who doesn't initiate much or have an elite handle (to say the least).
- Feel: Might be the one area where I understand the Shaun Livingston comp that frequently comes up.
- Theoretical shooting: This is a tough one, because the %'s were there, but the shot is definitely "unorthodox". It's hard
to see him either as a pull-up shooter or shooting at a high level off movement, which kind of boxes him into a spot-up 
shooter playing off the ball. But he could be good at that?!
- Theoretical defense: Again, the numbers/analytics tell me he should be a great a defender, but his slight frame,
lack of elite length or athleticism have me questioning how it translates to the next level.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Frame: How much strength can he add?
- Low usage: This was an issue that was a red flag with Lonzo and is similarly one for Haliburton. It's very hard to believe
he'll ever be a goto scorer. For this reason the comps to Shai are maddening, because aside from the fact that they
are both skinny, very different players and mentalities.
- Shooting: Just read what I said before!
- Ball handling: Needs to improve here if he's going to play on ball.
