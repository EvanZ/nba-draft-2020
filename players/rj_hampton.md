## Stats
```{margin}
```{Note}
I don't care so much about points, rebounds, or assists per se (eg I'm not doing this for fantasy projections). 
What I am presenting here are stats that I think are the most relevant to consider with respect to a prospect's (projected) NBA role.
None of these stats are guarantees of future success or necessarily harbingers of certain doom. They are just numbers to put into context with a player's overall profile.
```

```{admonition} Noteworthy
:class: note
- 2.76% STL%
- 1.68 A:TO
- 16.3% DRB%
```

```{Caution}
- 50.7% TS
- 29.4% 3P% (51 3PA)
- 73.7% FT% (38 FTA)
```

## Scouting
```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Athleticism: One of the best athletes in the class, maybe a notch below LaVine?
- Handle/Burst: Looks pretty good to me! Should be able to create space for a pull-up (assuming he can
ever improve the efficiency). Not efficient right now, but has the tools to be a volume shooter, which always
has some value in the league.
- Inside scoring potential: Can get to the rim and finish above it. Could work on touch.
``` 

```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Shooting: Needs some work. Kind of a flat shot that results in a lot of very bricky misses.
- Role?: Not sure if he's a primary, a bench scorer, or a starting 2. Would like to see him put on 10-15 pounds of muscle 
if it's the latter. His frame looks like it can carry a bit more weight than, say, Haliburton.
