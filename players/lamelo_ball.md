```{admonition} Strengths
:class: note
- Size: Elite point guard length and potential to add some more muscle on his frame.
- Age: Second youngest player in class. Does not turn 20 until next summer.
- Vision: Pretty much sees every play. This is his +++ talent.
- Skill: Can make the passes he sees. Handle is arguably elite, especially for his size. Shiftiness, change of speed, crossovers, etc.
- Confidence: This is an intangible that will be a plus if his shooting comes along.
- Late Bloomer: Non-zero chance he's still growing! 
```
```{admonition} Weaknesses
:class: warning
- Shooting: His best shooting indicator right now is a 70% FT%. His shooting form is clearly not textbook, although he has the deep range with it, and it's not as jacked up as Lonzo's shot was, which has gotten notably better in 3 seasons.
- Athleticism: I think he may actually be a bit underrated here, but at best he's probably a good, not great athlete.
- Effort/Motor: This is a question mark on the defensive end. Has tools and IQ to at least hold his own, if he truly cares about winning.
